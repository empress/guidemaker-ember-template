Every so often you might want to highlight a specific piece of information on the page. We recommend that you use a "callout" to do that.

For now we only support using html directly but hopefully soon you will be able to use components directly in the markdown ðŸŽ‰

<div class="cta">
  <div class="cta-note">
    <div class="cta-note-body">
      <div class="cta-note-heading">Zoey says...</div>
      <div class="cta-note-message">
        Here is some super friendly text that Zoey is making sure you take note of! When writing a callout you will need to use <strong>pure HTML</strong> inside because of the way that markdown deals with HTML blocks
      </div>
    </div>
    <img src="/images/mascots/zoey.png" role="presentation" alt="Ember Mascot">
  </div>
</div>

<div class="cta">
  <div class="cta-note">
    <div class="cta-note-body">
      <div class="cta-note-heading">Tomster says...</div>
      <div class="cta-note-message">
        Here is some super friendly text that Tomster is making sure you take note of! When writing a callout you will need to use <strong>pure HTML</strong> inside because of the way that markdown deals with HTML blocks
      </div>
